# bfp_perf_tools

While reading and going through, Brendan Gregg's book [BPF Performance Tools](https://www.informit.com/store/bpf-performance-tools-9780136554820), setting up BCC and BPF binaries has been painful experience. So, I am using this repo as a place as a play ground while I install and learn about BFP and BCC :)
